## The Challenge in Construction

Every day, your supervisors spend 90 minutes searching for missing project information and another 2+ hours on safety documentation. Meanwhile, only $\mathbf{3 0 \%}$ of your workers' time creates actual value-the rest is lost to waiting, transfers, and admin.

## Your Daily Reality:

The Same Arguments, Every Bloody Day "Where's your hard hat?" "Sign the SWMS." "I told you yesterday about those barriers." You became a construction manager to build things, not babysit grown adults who should know better.

Good Workers Go Where They're Valued Your best operators are getting poached by competitors. Why? Because workers talk, and word spreads fast about which sites treat them right. You're losing the talent war.

11 Head Office Only Sees Your Numbers When incidents go up, you get the call. When they go down, silence. You need metrics that make them notice you for the right reasons-and maybe that next promotion.

Nothing You Try Actually Sticks New safety initiative? Great for two weeks. Toolbox talks? They're on their phones. You need something that works when you're not standing right there watching.

## Frequently Asked Questions

How is this different from toolbox talks and safety incentive programs? Traditional safety programs focus on compliance through fear. Scratchie creates engagement through instant positive reinforcement. Instead of monthly safety BBQs that reward luck, you're recognising specific behaviours daily. It's the difference between hoping for safety and actively building it.

What if workers try to game the system? Built-in safeguards prevent gaming: random reward values, daily limits, pattern detection, and audit trails. Plus, when workers are "gaming" the system by demonstrating more safe behaviours to earn rewards, that's exactly the outcome you want.

How much should we budget for rewards? Most sites budget \$15-30 per worker per week, distributed across all workers. This replaces traditional safety incentive costs while delivering 10x better results. Remember: you're redirecting existing safety spend, not adding new costs.

Do workers need smartphones? For basic participation, yes. However, our Remote Awards feature lets supervisors recognise workers without phones, and our new ID card scanning feature (coming Q3) will support workers in restricted phone areas.

What if we already use Procore/SafetyCulture? Perfect! Scratchie enhances these platforms. We integrate seamlessly, adding the engagement layer that turns your safety data into safety action. Think of us as the motivational engine that makes your existing tools more effective.

Can this work on small residential sites? Absolutely. Our Freemium plan supports up to 5 workers at no cost. Many residential builders start there, then expand as they see results. The simplicity actually works better on smaller sites with less formal structure.

What about unions and safety regulations? Unions love Scratchie because it puts money in workers' pockets for being safe. We're fully compliant with all safety regulations and actually help you exceed requirements. Several union sites now mandate Scratchie-style positive recognition.
